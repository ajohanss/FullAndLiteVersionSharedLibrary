# Full and Lite Versions Sharing Common Code
This example that shows how you can use a common library to create a full blown application which is served by two shell apps that will determine the version of Full vs. Lite. All based upon package name.

This allows you to write the code once in the library and sprinkle if statements throughout to determine which version should have features, and which version should not.
